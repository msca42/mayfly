    I like apples and oranges.

    I also like bananas, mangoes, cherries, apricots,plums,peaches and grapes. You can see other fruits I like <a href="fruitlist.html">here</a>

    <strong>Warning:</strong> Eating too many oranges can give you heart burn.

    My favorite kind of orange is the mandarin, properly known as <i>citrus reticulata</i>
    Oranges at my local store cost <s>$1 each</s> $2 for 3.

    The <abbr title="Florida Department of Citrus">FDOC</abbr> regulates the Florida citrus industry.

    I still remember the best apple I ever tasted.
    I bought it at <time datetime="15:00">3 o'clock</time> on <time datetime="1984-12-7">December 6th</time>
